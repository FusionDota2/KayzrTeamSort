# KayzrTeamSort
Program used for sorting players into teams for Dota 2 tournaments.

Current versions:

  * DotaTeamMaker: First Algorithm
    * Distributes roles amongst players first. With priority from High to low MMR. Pos 1 to 5.
    * Only takes into account MMR at the time of player distribution

  * DotaTeamMaker_LowSupp
    * Same as DotaTeamMaker, only this gives low MMR players priority over support roles.
